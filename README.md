# Unexpected Null Handling in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to unexpected null handling in a function using strict equality checks.  The function `foo` is designed to perform an operation on two inputs, but does not handle null values correctly, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function uses strict equality (`===`) to compare inputs `a` and `b` against `null`. While this works for some cases, it may not cover all scenarios, especially if the function is designed to handle values that are loosely equivalent to null, such as undefined or empty strings.

## Solution

A robust solution involves explicit checks for null, undefined, or other values that the function should gracefully handle.  Loose equality (`==`) or type-checking (`typeof`) can be used for more flexible comparisons.
